# iris-classification
iris-classification using python
The provided Python code utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier on the Iris dataset. It first loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, standardizes the features using StandardScaler, and then trains a KNN classifier with k=3. The code evaluates the model's performance by calculating and displaying accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report on the test set. The input includes features (X) and target labels (y) from the Iris dataset, and the output consists of the model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
